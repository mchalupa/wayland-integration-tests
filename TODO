  * Add support for all wayland's objects
  * Add comments
  * Create wiki and README file to test/
  * Add benchmarks (API for benchmarks, not tests benchmarks)
  * Create tool for manipulation with benchmarks outcomes
  * Consider rewriting colorlog into some faster language. On the other side,
    shell is present everywhere.
  * Consider support for multiple wayland clients
