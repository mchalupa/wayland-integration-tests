When the test is run, it is measured how long it takes to finish the test.
The result is then saved in $(top_dir)/test/benchmarks/test_name.benchmark

The file structure is following:

timestamp commit seconds nanoseconds
timestamp commit seconds nanoseconds
timestamp commit seconds nanoseconds
...
...

Where timestamp is UNIX timestamp (time in seconds since the Epoch) and
commit is hash of commit that was HEAD when the test was started.
