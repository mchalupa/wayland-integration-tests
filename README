==========================
Wayland integration tests
==========================

This project aims to create small framework for simple testing
of interaction between wayland's display and client.

Directory structure:
TOP \
    src/    - framework sources
    test/   - tests, including self-tests

Part of this code was taken from wayland test-suite (namely test/test-runner.c,
test/test-runner.h and test/test-helpers.c).


=== Dependencies ===
Required:
 wayland-server
 wayland-client

Optional:
 libunwind


=== Building WIT ===
Autotools requierments:

 automake 1.11
 autoconf 2.64
 libtool 2.2

Getting WIT, compiling and running:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mchalupa/wayland-integration-tests
    $ cd wayland-integration-tests
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make
    $ make check

When only make is run then the framework is compiled. Tests are run by make check.


=== Running WIT ===

    $ make check

will compile and run all tests in test/ directory.

=== Versioning ===

WIT versioning should follow wayland's versioning e. g. WIT tests for wayland
of version a.b.c should have version a.b.c (or higher, considering backward
compability). Following this rule, it is possible that WIT versions will be
unconsistent (for example 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.9 - we wrote tests for 1.2., 1.2.1 and
then we changed/wrote new tests for wayland 1.2.9 and tests for versions between
this range are missing).
